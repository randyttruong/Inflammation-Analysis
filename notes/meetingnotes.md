**GitHub and Stuff** 



# What is Git?? 
-> A system for inputting, viewing, and reviewing revisions on code. 
	- 

## What is GitHub? 
-> A cloud-based Git, so we can see what other people have done to our projects, etc. 
-> There's a GUI and TUI interface 

Three main ideas in Git: 
-> Adding 
-> Committing
-> Pushing 

## Projects
-> Current Idea
-> Next Idea

- Report write-up (50/50) 

- Work on the weekends 

Project Timeline: 
- Start on Wednesday 
	- Think of alternative ideas 
	- Start on projects
	- Think of two questions each 
		- one (but maybe two) datasets for each that could be related
		- questions can include multiple datasets 
		- Think of a greater/higher meaning

	- questions.md
	- Send Jesus' presentation 

- Soft deadline on Friday, December 23
	- Have both datasets cleaned 
		- (4 hours each) 
		- Write notes and 
		possible relationships 
		- Explain why we are omitting different variables 
		- Check for Simpson's Paradox (make sure that everything is unique)
		- Statistical analysis (what is significant and what is not)
		- What conclusions can we draw straight from the statistics?
		- Interpretation
		- Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests  
			- Think of hypotheses 
		- Regression (math)  <- Stacy 
		

- Soft deadline on Wednesday, December 27 
	- Literally visualize data
	for everything (faceted histogram(?)) 
	- See if there's any possible relationships
	- (2 hours each) 
	- Analysis (what is significant from the different relationships in the dataset?)
	- And possible meaning... (interpretation)

- Deadline on Friday, December 29
	- Write the report 
	- We'll think about who does what towards the end (Wednesday, Decmeber 27)

- The fairy dust on top 
	- Google Data Studio 
		- Makes data pretty(?)
