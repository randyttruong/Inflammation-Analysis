# Abstract 

# Introduction 
In this project, we will be analyzing inflammation and its possible correlation between race and ethnicity as a possible predictor of disease incidence between different races and ethnicities. We will first be analyzing what exactly inflammation is, its chemical and biological origins, the repercussions of these origins origins, and its correlation with disease on a grand scale.
