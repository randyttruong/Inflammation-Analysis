# Correlating Inflammation and Disease Incidence Between Race and Ethnicity 

In this project, we will be analyzing inflammation and its possible correlation between race and ethnicity as a possible predictor of disease incidence between different races and ethnicities. We will first be analyzing what exactly inflammation is, its potential causes from a chemical and biological perspective, the repercussions of its chemical and biological origins, and finally, its correlation with disease on a grand scale.
