# Abstract 

# Introduction 
In this project, we will be analyzing inflammation and its possible correlation between race and ethnicity as a possible predictor of disease incidence between different races and ethnicities. We will first be analyzing what exactly inflammation is, its chemical and biological origins, the repercussions of these origins origins, and its correlation with disease on a grand scale. 

# Datasets 

# Hypotheses 
- Hispanics and Blacks will have the highest levels of CRP. 
- CRP levels will be a strong predictor of CVD and Diabetes in Hispanic and Black populations. 

# Visualizations

This chart visualizes the proportion of the sample diagnosed with CVD or Diabetes categorized by race. As seen here, both CVD and diabetes are most diagnosed within the Black population. 

# Conclusions 
Overall, the relationship between inflammation and CVD and diabetes presence differs between ethnic groups. CRP levels are highest in Hispanic and Black populations. Additionally, CVD and diabetes is most diagnosed within the Black population. Moreever, the relationship between log(hsCRP) and CVD is strongest within the Asian population. Finally, log(hsCRP) is the strongest predictor of diabetes within White and Hispanic populations. 

We suggest that future studies can examine different factors that may account for these differences in relationships by race.
