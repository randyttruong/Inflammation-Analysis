# Load Data

```{r loadData, message = FALSE}

# Tidy Data 
 Column "Race" is added because there is not a column or row for race in the
 original CSVs, as each CSV only included data from one race.
 Column "...1" is renamed for clarity.

```{r tidyData, message = FALSE}
clean_asian_df <- mutate(asian_df, Race = "Asian") %>%
  rename(Question = ...1) %>%
  filter(Question %in% c(
    "Diagnosed with any CVD",
    "Ever diagnosed with diabetes W5",
    "log10(hsCRP) W4"
    ))

clean_black_df <- mutate(black_df, Race = "Black") %>%
  rename(Question = ...1) %>%
  filter(Question %in% c(
    "Diagnosed with any CVD",
    "Ever diagnosed with diabetes W5",
    "log10(hsCRP) W4"
    ))

clean_hispanic_df <- mutate(hispanic_df, Race = "Hispanic") %>%
  rename(Question = ...1) %>%
  filter(Question %in% c(
    "Diagnosed with any CVD",
    "Ever diagnosed with diabetes W5",
    "log10(hsCRP) W4"
    ))

clean_white_df <- mutate(white_df, Race = "White") %>%
  rename(Question = ...1) %>%
  filter(Question %in% c(
    "Diagnosed with any CVD",
    "Ever diagnosed with diabetes W5",
    "log10(hsCRP) W4"
    ))
